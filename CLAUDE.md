# Athen -- Universal AI Agent

Athen is a **universal, proactive AI agent** built as a native desktop application (Tauri 2 + Rust). It monitors emails, calendar, messages, and direct input ("senses"), evaluates what needs doing, and executes tasks autonomously -- with a dynamic risk system that decides when to act silently vs. ask for permission. Designed for non-technical users: single binary, native GUI, zero runtime dependencies.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Core | Rust | Speed, memory safety, native cross-platform |
| UI | Tauri 2 | Native app with web frontend, tiny binaries |
| MCPs | Rust binaries | Standalone tools, no runtime deps |
| Database | SQLite | Embedded, serverless, portable |
| Shell | Nushell (embedded) | Cross-platform consistent shell + native fallback |
| Sandbox | OS-native + Podman/Docker | Tiered isolation, zero user setup for OS-native |

## Architecture

Multi-process architecture communicating over IPC (Unix sockets / Named pipes).

```
SENTIDOS (Monitors) --IPC--> SENSE ROUTER (Tauri) --events--> COORDINADOR
                                                                   |
                                                          IPC (TaskAssignments)
                                                         /    |    \
                                                    Agent1  Agent2  AgentN
                                                         \    |    /
                                                      EXECUTION LAYER
                                              (MCPs + Shell + Scripts + HTTP)
```

## Design Principles (CRITICAL)

### 1. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

`athen-core` defines ALL traits (ports). Every other crate implements adapters. No crate depends on a sibling -- only on `athen-core`. `athen-app` is the composition root that wires implementations together.

### 2. Dependency Rules

- `athen-core` depends on NOTHING internal (only serde, chrono, uuid, thiserror, async-trait, url, tokio-stream)
- All other crates depend on `athen-core` for trait definitions
- Crates NEVER depend on sibling crates (except through `athen-core` traits)
- `athen-app` is the ONLY crate that depends on multiple siblings
- Future bundled MCPs (Slack, Notion, ...) will live under `crates/mcps/` as standalone JSON-RPC servers that do NOT depend on `athen-core`

### 3. Independent Testability

Every crate can be tested in isolation by mocking trait dependencies.

## Coding Guidelines

- Async: `tokio` runtime, `#[async_trait]` for trait definitions
- Errors: `thiserror` with `AthenError` enum and `Result<T>` from `athen-core::error`
- Serialization: `serde` with `Serialize`/`Deserialize` derives
- IDs: `uuid::Uuid` v4 | Timestamps: `chrono::DateTime<Utc>`
- Platform-specific: `#[cfg(target_os = "...")]`
- Logging: `tracing` crate
- HTTP: `reqwest` with `rustls-tls` (no OpenSSL)
- Tests: mock trait dependencies, not real services
- `cargo clippy --workspace` must produce zero warnings
- All config via UI, never config files -- Athen is for non-technical users
- NEVER commit or push to git unless explicitly asked by the user

## Key Commands

```bash
# Build & test
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace

# Run CLI
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-... cargo run -p athen-cli --release

# Run desktop app
cargo tauri dev    # (from crates/athen-app/)

# System libs needed (Fedora)
# webkit2gtk4.1-devel gtk3-devel libsoup3-devel libappindicator-gtk3-devel
```

## Platform Workarounds

- **Linux WebKitGTK + AMD/RADV stutter**: `crates/athen-app/src/main.rs` forces `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` at startup. The DMABUF renderer in WebKitGTK 2.44+ stalls the compositor on AMD/Mesa, causing system-wide stutter. Remove once upstream ships a fix and the older GLX path is no longer needed.

## CI/CD

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` -- clippy + tests on push to main + PRs
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` -- cross-platform Tauri builds (Linux/macOS/Windows)

## Detailed Documentation

Read the relevant doc BEFORE working on a feature area:

- [Architecture, Core Types & Security](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — Read when: adding/modifying traits, types, risk system, IPC, error handling, or security model
- [Implementation Status by Crate](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) — Read when: you need to understand what a crate does, its current state, test counts, or what files exist. Update this file after implementing changes.
- [Configuration & LLM Providers](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) — Read when: working on config loading, LLM providers, model profiles, failover, domain settings, embeddings, or web search keys/chain
- [Tools, Senses & Notifications](docs/TOOLS_AND_SENSES.md) — Read when: working on agent tools, sense monitors, sandbox execution, notification delivery, or the web search/page-reader providers
- [Arc Compaction](docs/ARC_COMPACTION.md) — Read when: working on context-window management, arc summarization, or anything that touches `ArcStore::load_entries` in the executor path. Design doc; not yet implemented.
- [Multi-Intent Routing](docs/MULTI_INTENT_ROUTING.md) — Read when: extending the Telegram owner-message path to split a single message into N per-arc intents (task #152), OR adding standing instructions / coordinator-as-agent memory ("for the next 4h, reply on Telegram"). Design doc; not yet implemented. Builds on #149's single-intent heuristic.
- [Identity](docs/IDENTITY.md) — Read when: building the user-maintained personality/rules/knowledge/team store that feeds every agent's static prefix. Categories are user-editable, entries are tagged with `applies_to` so each agent profile only pays for the sections it needs. Distinct from `athen-memory` (auto-learned, recalled per-query) and from agent profiles (define what an agent does, not who Athen is). Design doc; not yet implemented.
- [Wake-ups](docs/WAKEUPS.md) — Read when: working on scheduled / recurring / one-shot proactive triggers (reminders, daily digests, deferred follow-ups), including the agent-authored `create_wakeup` tool. Wake-ups are synthetic sense events with a clock as their trigger; they reuse coordinator/risk/dispatch. Risk model is "pre-approve capability, not content" via per-wake-up `AutonomyBand` + tool/contact allowlists, with the existing per-action risk gate still firing at fire time. Implemented; doc remains the conceptual reference.
- [Packaging & Distribution](docs/PACKAGING.md) — Read when: cutting a release, debugging the auto-updater, or adding a distribution channel. Covers AUR, COPR, GitHub Releases, the `installer_kind` self-update vs system-package split, and the per-release checklist.
- [Per-Model Quirks](docs/PER_MODEL_QUIRKS.md) — Read when: adding a new model/family to the provider stack, debugging tool-call extraction failures, reasoning-content surface mismatches, or strict-template HTTP 500s on local inference (Qwen/Gemma/DeepSeek). Design doc; ToolExtraction/Reasoning/TemplateStrictness axes are partially implemented (TemplateStrictness via `external_system_suffix`); ToolExtraction + Reasoning still pending. User-driven family selection (UI dropdown + editable slug), no auto-detection.
- [Prompt Caching](docs/PROMPT_CACHING.md) — Read when: touching any LLM provider request/response path, the `TokenUsage` struct, or cost estimation. Per-provider audit (Anthropic/OpenAI/DeepSeek/Google) of how prompt caching works on the wire and where Athen currently leaves money on the table. Design doc; not yet implemented. Anthropic gap is severe (zero `cache_control` markers + missing `tools` field), DeepSeek gap is observability-only (cache fires but cost UI lies).
- [Memory](docs/MEMORY.md) — Read when: touching auto-recall injection, the post-turn `judge_worth_remembering` flow, the `memory_store` / `memory_recall` agent tools, or the relevance threshold. Memory is the episodic auto-recall store; distinct from Identity (always-on, in the static prefix). Covers dedup at all three layers (auto-judge sees existing memories, `memory_store` skips duplicates, recall threshold raised to 0.6).
- [Tool Expansion Menu](docs/TOOL_EXPANSION.md) — Read when: picking the next agent tool to wrap, or when an existing tool category needs a refresh. 10-category survey (browser, docs, OCR, GitHub, audio/video, db, social, outreach, scraping, jobs) with top pick + footprint + wrap shape + risk + fit per category. Picking menu, not a build plan; per-category implementation docs land when each category is shipped.
- [Cloud APIs Expansion](docs/CLOUD_APIS.md) — Read when: working on the `http_request` agent tool or the Registered HTTP Endpoints store. Architecture sketch + 15 preset endpoints (Jina, Firecrawl, Hunter, Apollo, PDL, DeepL, NewsAPI, Adzuna, Brave Search, OpenCage, Open-Meteo, Frankfurter, ElevenLabs, Cal.com, OpenRouter, Groq, Wikipedia). One ship unlocks ~15 APIs; #1 in updated ship order. Depends on a credential-at-rest crypto module that doesn't exist yet.
